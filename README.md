This is a web page used for building treasure hunt.
The idea is to make it easy to type in clues which generate QR codes.
We then hide these codes around the house.

The page is a 3x2 html table
Each cell has two text boxes (and a qR code). 
The first text box is for typing the clue. This generates the QR code as you type.
The second box is for writing where to hide the next clue. (helps when hiding the clues around the house)
There's a toggle button to hide the clues when it's time to print.
